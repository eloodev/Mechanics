## About us!
We did it, automation comes after Minecraft. Through Mechanics you get the industrial revulution! From the grain of wheat away to the furnace for stones everything is fully automated. See it for yourself!


## Let's get started!
Be sure that you have the latest version on the Minecraft server.
- Get the latest version: Download
- Put the file into the plugin folder
- Start the server to generate the config file (Mechanics will deactivate itself at the first start!)
- Configure the plugin based on your needs.
- Finally, restart the server and have a lot of fun!
